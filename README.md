# Cofferly

Cofferly is a small Windows-friendly Rust desktop app for tracking money held for kids.

It starts with two neutral child wallets. Each wallet keeps a local ledger of deposits and deductions, similar to a handwritten allowance sheet:

- Starting balance
- Money added
- Money spent
- Description for each entry
- Date
- Automatic running balance
- Parent PIN unlock
- Printable ledgers
- Custom child wallet names

## Download

For a local build, the Windows executable is:

```text
target\release\Cofferly.exe
```

For a portable release zip:

```powershell
.\scripts\package-windows.ps1 -Version 0.1.0
```

The zip will be created in `dist/`.

## Parent PIN

Cofferly opens to a parent PIN screen so kids cannot add or remove entries without a parent unlocking the app first.

The first-run PIN is:

```text
1234
```

After unlocking, use **Change PIN** in the left sidebar to choose a different 4 digit PIN.

The PIN is used both to unlock the interface and to derive the key for encrypting the data file on disk. It is a simple family-use protection (4 digits), not high-security encryption.

## Child Wallets

Cofferly starts with `Child 1` and `Child 2` so the public app does not include anyone's real names.

After unlocking parent mode, use **Child names** to rename the selected wallet or add another child wallet.

## Printing

Use **Print this ledger** to print the selected child's ledger, or **Print both ledgers** to print both child wallets together.

Cofferly creates a local printable HTML file and opens it in your browser with the print dialog ready.

## Windows Installer

The repository includes an Inno Setup script at `installer/Cofferly.iss`.

Build the release executable first:

```powershell
cargo build --release
```

Then open `installer/Cofferly.iss` in Inno Setup and compile the installer. The installer output is written to `dist/`.

## Development

Install Rust from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs), then run:

```powershell
cargo run
```

To create a release build:

```powershell
cargo build --release
```

The app stores data locally in your operating system's app data folder.

Data files are encrypted at rest using the parent PIN (Argon2id key derivation + XChaCha20-Poly1305 authenticated encryption). This protects against casual tampering with the ledger file.

Old plain JSON files (including imports from Atlas Wallet / TallyNest / AirWallet) are automatically migrated to the encrypted format the first time you successfully unlock with the parent PIN.

If `cargo` is not on PATH on Windows, add Rust's Cargo folder to PATH:

```powershell
$env:Path += ";$env:USERPROFILE\.cargo\bin"
cargo run
```
